## Out Of Sight! | Initial Playground Build | 08.11.22
***Even more emphasis on ideas***

###  A New Exploration

After many nights thinking about how this might look, we have landed on trying a "playground" version of this that amounts to a step sequencer.
The idea is this:
* Present the factory as a single screen
* This screen has 4 conveyor belts transferring goods from one side of the screen to the next
* As these good hit the tube apparatus they play a randomized note
* The player needs to remove "wrong" packages from the belt to increase their success-rate thereby adding positive musical effects

### Success?

* The musical track is built and it seems like it will actually work really well with this idea. Also, it feels like a straight up, *jam* but.. we're biased
* This version has a conveyor belt transporting goods from right to left. You can click on the goods to remove them, and there is a counter that acknowledges "proper" vs "improper" goods. We'll need to make this more flexible, but it's a start

### Next Steps

* Integrate music into this iteration - then we'll get a better idea if the rhythm works (and how to use FMOD to control tempo)
* There's a lot more that needs to be done, but this has to happen first before it's even possible to think about those steps
